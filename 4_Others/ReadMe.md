## **Team Member Contributions**
Each subfolder contains files and documentation related to individual contributions. These may include:
- Model implementations
- Data preprocessing scripts
- Experimentation with different techniques
- Research and documentation

### **How to Navigate the Contributions**
1. **Browse Individual Folders:** Each folder contains the files related to that team member’s work.
2. **Check for Documentation:** Some team members may have included additional notes or `README` files in their folders to explain their contributions.
3. **Use Files for Reference:** These contributions can be used for further analysis or improvement of the project.

## **Notes**
- The work in this folder may not be part of the final implementation but serves as a record of team efforts.
- If using any code from these folders, ensure compatibility with the main project pipeline.
