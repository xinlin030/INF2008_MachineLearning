## **Files/Subfolder Descriptions**
### **1. DBSCAN (PCA/t-SNE/UMAP + Silhouette Score + Spectral Clustering) Python Script**
- Contains the implementation of **DB scan with a combination of 3 dimensionality techniques**, coupled with silhouette score as a means of accuracy and measurement.

### **2. DBSCAN (PCA/t-SNE/UMAP + Silhouette Score + Spectral Clustering) Jupyter Notebook**
- Contains the implementation of **DB scan with a combination of 3 dimensionality techniques**, coupled with silhouette score as a means of accuracy and measurement. This version already includes images within the notebook for ease of viewing charts.

### **3. Charts**
- Contains:
  - Relevant results that are generated by the calculations in the algorithm script.

## **How to Use**
1. Navigate to the respective algorithm folder.
2. Run the provided Python scripts to train models and generate outputs.
   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Review the output files and visualizations to analyze the results.

## **Notes**
- These algorithms were tested but may not be part of the final project.
- The code and results serve as reference material for further analysis.
