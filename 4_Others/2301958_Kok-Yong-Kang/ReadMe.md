## Subfolder Descriptions
### 1.INF2008_Project_[KMeans_+_DBSCAN]
This folder contains the implementation of K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms for unsupervised learning using Jupyter Notebooks.
Includes:
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with code, explanations, and results.
- Cluster assignments and performance metrics.
- Visualizations illustrating the clustering results.


## How to Use
1. Navigate to the respective algorithm folder.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.
3. Run the notebook cells if needed to train the models and generate outputs.
4. Review the visualizations and results directly within the notebook.

## Notes
- These algorithms were tested but may not be part of the final project.
- The code and results serve as reference material for further analysis.
