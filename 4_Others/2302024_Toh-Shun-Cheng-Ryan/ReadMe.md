# Contribution by Toh Shun Cheng, Ryan

## Overview
This folder contains the work contributed by **Toh Shun Cheng, Ryan** as part of the project, which contains implementations of two clustering algorithms: DBSCAN and KMeans. Each algorithm has its own folder containing the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb), the Python script (.py), and scatter plot images illustrating the clustering results.

## Folder Structure
```
2302024_Toh-Shun-Cheng-Ryan/
│── DBSCAN/   
│── KMeans/
│── README.md
```

## **Subfolder Descriptions**
### **1. DBSCAN**
- Contains the implementation of **DBSCAN** clustering algorithm.
- Includes:
  - r_dbscan.py: Python script version of the DBSCAN implementation.
  - r_dbscan.ipynb: Jupyter notebook implementing DBSCAN clustering.
  - Visual representations of the DBSCAN clustering results.

### **2. KMeans**
- Contains the implementation of **KMeans** clustering algorithm.
- Contains:
  - r_kmeans.py: Python script version of the KMeans implementation.
  - r_kmeans.ipynb: Jupyter notebook implementing KMeans clustering.
  - Visual representations of the KMeans clustering results.

## **How to Use**
1. Navigate to the respective algorithm folder.
2. Choose to either run the provided Python script or run the Jupyter Notebook file.
   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Review the output files and visualizations to analyze the results.

## **Notes**
- These algorithms were tested but may not be part of the final project.
- The code and results serve as reference material for further analysis.
