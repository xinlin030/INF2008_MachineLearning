## **Subfolder Descriptions**
### **1. Agglomerative_DBSCAN**
- Contains the implementation of **Agglomerative Clustering and DBscan**, includes both a top-down and bottom-up approach to clustering.
- Includes:
  - Python scripts for model training.
  - Output files showing cluster assignments.
  - Visualizations illustrating the hierarchical structure.

### **2. DBSCAN_Research**
- Includes **DBScan** early DBscan exploration aand research on implementing machine learning algorithms in python code.
- Contains:
  - A script for training the model.

### **3. Test Cases**
- Includes the **test cases**, used for the evaluation of Agglomerative and DBScan clustering.
- Contains:
  - 7 .CSV files that contain pairs of TOSP codes.
  - Description of the test case and whether it is supposed to be invalid or valid.

## **How to Use**
1. Navigate to the respective algorithm folder.
2. Run the provided Python scripts to train models and generate outputs.
   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Review the output files and visualizations to analyze the results.

## **Notes**
- These algorithms were tested but may not be part of the final project.
- The code and results serve as reference material for further analysis.
