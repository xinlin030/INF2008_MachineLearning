## **Notebook and Models Descriptions**
### **1. KMeans and DBSCAN**
- Contains the exploration and testing of **KMeans and DBSCAN** clustering algorithms.


### **2. Aggolomerative and Spectral Clustering**
- Contains the exploration and testing of **Aggolomerative and Spectral Clustering** clustering algorithms.

### **3. Agg_Model and Spectral_Model `.pkl`**
- Contains the downloaded trained model using `joblib`.

## **How to Use**
1. Navigate to the respective notebooks.
2. Insert the `combined_dataset.csv` and run the notebooks.
3. Review the output of the notebook. The results have been pre-captured in the notebooks.

## **Notes**
- These algorithms were tested but may not be part of the final project.
- The code and results serve as reference material for further analysis.
