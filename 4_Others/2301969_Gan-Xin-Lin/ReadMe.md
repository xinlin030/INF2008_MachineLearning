## **Subfolder Descriptions**
### **1. Divisive Hierarchical Clustering**
- Contains the implementation of **Divisive Hierarchical Clustering**, a top-down approach to hierarchical clustering.
- Includes:
  - Python scripts for model training.
  - Output files showing cluster assignments.
  - Visualizations illustrating the hierarchical structure.

### **2. Random Forest Analysis**
- Includes **Random Forest** experiments for feature importance and classification.
- Contains:
  - Scripts for training and evaluating the model.
  - Output reports and performance metrics.
  - Visualizations such as feature importance plots.

### **3. XGBoost**
- Implements and fine-tunes **XGBoost**, a gradient boosting algorithm.
- Contains:
  - Python scripts for training and optimizing the model.
  - Performance metrics and evaluation outputs.
  - Visualizations for hyperparameter tuning and results.

## **How to Use**
1. Navigate to the respective algorithm folder.
2. Run the provided Python scripts to train models and generate outputs.
   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Review the output files and visualizations to analyze the results.

## **Notes**
- These algorithms were tested but may not be part of the final project.
- The code and results serve as reference material for further analysis.
