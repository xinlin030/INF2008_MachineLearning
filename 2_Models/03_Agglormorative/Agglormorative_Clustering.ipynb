        "The Table of Surgical Procedures (TOSP) is an exhaustive list of surgical procedures eligible for MediSave/MediShield Life claims. Inappropriate TOSP claims occur when multiple TOSP codes are submitted for a single procedure that could be adequately described by one code. This leads to unnecessary claims and increased healthcare costs.\n",

        "This notebook aims to apply Agglormorative Clustering to flag cases where submitted TOSP codes are too similar and may indicate inappropriate claims. Since no labeled data is provided, the best approach is to use unsupervised learning models. The input data consists primarily of the \"Descriptions\" column, which captures the textual details of each procedure.\n",

        "Agglomerative Clustering (a hierarchical clustering method) was suggested by Prof. Donny as a potential improvement. Unlike KMeans and DBSCAN, which rely on predefined cluster counts or density thresholds, Agglomerative Clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters, allowing for a more flexible and interpretable structure. Given that TOSP codes naturally form small groups (typically 2-3 similar procedures per cluster), this method may be better suited for detecting inappropriate TOSP code pairs. This notebook will evaluate Agglomerative Clustering and determine if it is the most effective at identifying redundant or overlapping TOSP codes.\n",

A sharp drop in the score around 1800 clusters indicates improved cluster separation compared to earlier values. After 1800 clusters, the score continues to decrease gradually, suggesting diminishing returns and potential overfitting. Therefore, 1800 clusters is chosen as the optimal value for the Agglomerative Clustering model."

However, some inaccuracies were observed, particularly in cases where descriptions contained similar phrases but described fundamentally different procedures.\n",
