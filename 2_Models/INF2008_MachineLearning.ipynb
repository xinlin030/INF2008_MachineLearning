        "Particularly, the model works well in detecting similar TOSP codes if the word difference in the description of the procedure is less than about 2 words for decriptions with different word lenths. For descriptions with slight differences but the same length, the model may miss it. This can be seen in test case 4 where despite being largely similar at the front, the model still considers them as separate due to 2 different words at the end, which is not very accurate.\n",

        "## Accuracy\n",
        "Both the DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering models can capture descriptions that have at most 1 or 2 different words with different lengths. When the DBSCAN epsilon value was increased to 0.25, the model is able to detect descriptions with higher difference in words, but also may cause some valid pairs to be clustered together for having similar phrases despite being 2 totally different procedures. This may be attributed to not being able to capture the semantics of the descriptions such as the following: <br>\n",

        "For working on the entire combined dataset, finding the best n_clusters value for agglomerative clustering takes about 51 seconds while the time taken to actual training after finding a suitable value is around 0.8s. The range of values used to test ranges from 1000 to 2364 (total number of rows), with an increment of 50 each step\n",

        "Given the 2 lists of 9 epsilon and 6 MinPts values to test on, the DBSCAN model testing takes approximately 13s to calculate the Davies Bouldin score to find the best epsilon and MinPts. The training of the model with the epsilon and MinPts values found takes about 0.12s\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, both models presented good performances as it does not take much computational resources or time in training or testing the models and both models also produce similar results, with DBSCAN being slightly more sensitive to similar descriptions when 0.15 is used as an epsilon instead of 0.1.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "With a value of 0.1 and 0.15, the DBSCAN model produces relatively decent accuracy on TOSP code pairs that are submitted with both BILATERAL and UNILATERAL/ MULTIPLE and SINGLE or description pairs whose difference is just a modifier with a few words. Increasing the epsilon to 0.15 passes more of the 7 chosen test cases, but further testing proved that false positives happen more frequently.\n",
